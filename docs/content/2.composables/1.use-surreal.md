# useSurreal

The `useSurreal` composable returns the main `Surreal` client instance connected to your remote SurrealDB endpoint. It auto-connects on first use based on your module configuration.

## Usage

```vue [app/pages/index.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const client = await useSurreal()

// Use the SDK directly
const results = await client.query('SELECT * FROM users;').json().collect(0)
</script>
```

## Return type

Returns `Promise<Surreal>` — the connected SurrealDB client instance from the official SDK.

## How it works

1. On first call, the composable reads the endpoint and connection options from `runtimeConfig.public.surrealdb`
2. If `autoConnect` is enabled (default), it connects automatically
3. During SSR, if `preferHttp` is enabled (default), WebSocket URLs are converted to HTTP
4. The `surrealdb:connecting` and `surrealdb:connected` hooks are called during the connection lifecycle

## Direct SDK access

You can also access the Surreal client directly via the Nuxt app instance:

```ts
const { $surreal } = useNuxtApp()
```

Available properties:
- `$surreal` — the remote `Surreal` client
- `$surrealMemory` — the in-memory WASM client (or `null`)
- `$surrealLocal` — the local WASM client (or `null`)
